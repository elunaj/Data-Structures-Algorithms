// If you know a solution is not far from the root
// of the tree:

BFS, starts searching nodes closest to parent nodes

// If the tree is very deep and
// solutions are rare

BFS, DFS will take a long time because of tree depth 

// If the tree is very wide:

DFS, BFS will take longer due to tree width (needs too much memory)

// If solutions are frequent but
// located deep in the tree:

DFS

// Determining whether a path
// exists between two nodes:

DFS

// Finding the shortest path: 

BFS
